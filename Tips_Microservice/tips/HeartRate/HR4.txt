Maintain a healthy weight
Dropping a few pounds and getting leaner can help bring down your heart rate. “The more weight you carry, the harder your body has to work to move blood through the body — especially if you don’t have a lot of muscle mass,” says Dr. Singh.
Embracing good nutrition and regular exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight. Plus, they’re good for your overall heart health. Consider it a win-win.
