Get moving
The most common cause of a high resting heart rate is a sedentary lifestyle, where you spend a lot of time not moving. The No. 1 way to lower your resting heart rate into a healthier range? Exercise, says Dr. Singh.
“The more you exercise, the stronger your heart becomes,” notes Dr. Singh. “Since it’s pumping more blood with each beat, it won’t need to pump as hard — which will lower your heart rate.”
To give your heart a healthy workout, the American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous activity.
Exercise brings other benefits, too, of course, as being in poor shape can increase the risk of problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes and weight gain.
