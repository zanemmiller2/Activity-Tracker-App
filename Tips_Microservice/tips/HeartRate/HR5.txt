Stay hydrated
Drinking water makes your heartâ€™s job easier. Dehydration can cause the blood to thicken, which means your ticker has to work harder to push blood around. So wet your whistle to give your heart a break and lower resting heart rate.
Try to avoid alcohol, too, as it can contribute to dehydration. (Alcohol also can boost heart rate, by the way.)
