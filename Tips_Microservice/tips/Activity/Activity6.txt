Here are 10 small ways to increase physical activity throughout your day:
	* Take the stairs instead of the elevator
	* Park farther away from the front door
	* Stand instead of sitting (this burns more calories)
	* Take a walk on your lunch break
	* Walk or bike to your destination instead of driving
	* Sit on an exercise ball at your desk instead of a chair (this builds core strength)
	* Do stretches or ride a stationary bike while watching TV
	* During commercial breaks do abdominal crunches, jumping jacks, push-ups, or simply get up 	  and walk around
	* Take a 10 minute walk in the morning and/or evening
	* Play outside with your kids
